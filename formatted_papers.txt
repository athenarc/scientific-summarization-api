Title: Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning in smart cities
Abstract: Smart cities are aimed to efficiently manage growing urbanization, energy consumption, maintain a green environment, improve the economic and living standards of their citizens, and raise the people’s capabilities to efficiently use and adopt the modern information and communication technology (ICT). In the smart cities concept, ICT is playing a vital role in policy design, decision, implementation, and ultimate productive services. The primary objective of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the evolution of smart cities. The preceding techniques are efficiently used to design optimal policy regarding various smart city-oriented complex problems. In this survey, we present in-depth details of the applications of the prior techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), cyber-security, energy-efficient utilization of smart grids (SGs), effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assure the best services of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications, and smart health care system in a smart city. Finally, we present various research challenges and future research directions where the aforementioned techniques can play an outstanding role to realize the concept of a smart city.

Title: DeepFed: Federated Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Industrial Cyber–Physical Systems
Abstract: The rapid convergence of legacy industrial infrastructures with intelligent networking and computing technologies (e.g., 5G, software-defined networking, and artificial intelligence), have dramatically increased the attack surface of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs). However, withstanding cyber threats to such large-scale, complex, and heterogeneous industrial CPSs has been extremely challenging, due to the insufficiency of high-quality attack examples. In this article, we propose a novel federated deep learning scheme, named DeepFed, to detect cyber threats against industrial CPSs. Specifically, we first design a new deep learning-based intrusion detection model for industrial CPSs, by making use of a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit. Second, we develop a federated learning framework, allowing multiple industrial CPSs to collectively build a comprehensive intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving way. Further, a Paillier cryptosystem-based secure communication protocol is crafted to preserve the security and privacy of model parameters through the training process. Extensive experiments on a real industrial CPS dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed DeepFed scheme in detecting various types of cyber threats to industrial CPSs and the superiorities over state-of-the-art schemes.

Title: Deep recurrent neural network for IoT intrusion detection system
Abstract: As a results of the large scale development of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing capabilities including networking, data storage, management, and analytics are brought very close to the edge of networks forming Fog computing and enhancing transferring and processing of tremendous amount of data. As the Internet becomes more deeply integrated into our business operations through IoT platform, the desire for reliable and efficient connections increases as well. Fog and Cloud security is a topical issue associated with every data storage, managing or processing paradigm. Attacks once occurred, have ineradicable and disastrous effects on the development of IoT, Fog, Cloud computing. Therefore, many security systems/models have been proposed and/or implemented for the sake of Fog security. Intrusion detection systems are one of the premier choices especially ones that designed using artificial intelligence. In our paper, we presented an artificially full-automated intrusion detection system for Fog security against cyber-attacks. The proposed model uses multi-layered of recurrent neural networks designed to be implemented for Fog computing security that is very close to the end-users and IoT devices. We demonstrated our proposed model using a balanced version of the challenging dataset: NSL-KDD. The performance of our model was measured using a variety of typical metrics, and we add two additional metrics: Mathew correlation and Cohen's Kappa coefficients for deeper insight. where the experimental results and simulations proved the stability and robustness of the proposed model in terms of a variety of performance metrics.

Title: A new distributed architecture for evaluating AI-based security systems at the edge: Network TON_IoT datasets
Abstract: While there has been a significant interest in understanding the cyber threat landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security approaches, there is a lack of distributed architecture led to generating heterogeneous datasets that contain the actual behaviors of real-world IoT networks and complex cyber threat scenarios to evaluate the credibility of the new systems. This paper presents a novel testbed architecture of IoT network which can be used to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security applications. The platform NSX vCloud NFV was employed to facilitate the execution of Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Orchestration (SO) to offer dynamic testbed networks, which allow the interaction of edge, fog and cloud tiers. While deploying the architecture, real-world normal and attack scenarios are executed to collect labeled datasets. The generated datasets are named ‘TON_IoT’, as they comprise heterogeneous data sources collected from telemetry datasets of IoT services, Windows and Linux-based datasets, and datasets of network traffic. The TON_IoT network dataset is validated using four machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms of Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Neural Networks, revealing a high performance of detection accuracy using the set of training and testing. A comparative summary of the TON_IoT network dataset and other competing network datasets demonstrates its diverse legitimate and anomalous patterns that can be used to better validate new AI-based security solutions. The architecture and datasets can be publicly accessed from TON_IOT Datasets (2020).

Title: Machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection: Datasets and comparative study
Abstract: The increase in internet usage brings security problems with it. Malicious software can affect the operation of the systems and disrupt data confidentiality due to the security gaps in the systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed to detect and report attacks. In order to develop IDS systems, artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used more frequently. In this study, literature studies using CSE-CIC IDS-2018, UNSW-NB15, ISCX-2012, NSL-KDD and CIDDS-001 data sets, which are widely used to develop IDS systems, are reviewed in detail. In addition, max-min normalization was performed on these data sets and classification was made with support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) algorithms, which are among the classical machine learning approaches. As a result, more successful results have been obtained in some of the studies given in the literature. The study is thought to be useful for developing IDS systems on the basis of artificial intelligence with approaches such as machine learning.

Title: IntruDTree: A Machine Learning-Based Cyber Security Intrusion Detection Model
Abstract: Cyber security has recently received enormous attention in today’s security concerns, due to the popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the tremendous growth of computer networks, and the huge number of relevant applications. Thus, detecting various cyber-attacks or anomalies in a network and building an effective intrusion detection system that performs an essential role in today’s security is becoming more important. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree (“IntruDTree”) machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features. This model is not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy for unseen test cases but also minimizes the computational complexity of the model by reducing the feature dimensions. Finally, the effectiveness of our IntruDTree model was examined by conducting experiments on cybersecurity datasets and computing the precision, recall, fscore, accuracy, and ROC values to evaluate. We also compare the outcome results of IntruDTree model with several traditional popular machine learning methods such as the naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor, to analyze the effectiveness of the resulting security model.

Title: Artificial intelligence in Internet of things
Abstract: Functioning of the Internet is persistently transforming from the Internet of computers (IoC) to the ‘Internet of things (IoT)’. Furthermore, massively interconnected systems, also known as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), are emerging from the assimilation of many facets like infrastructure, embedded devices, smart objects, humans, and physical environments. What the authors are heading to is a huge ‘Internet of Everything in a Smart Cyber Physical Earth’. IoT and CPS conjugated with ‘data science’ may emerge as the next ‘smart revolution’. The concern that arises then is to handle the huge data generated with the much weaker existing computation power. The research in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) has been striving to give an answer to this problem. Thus, IoT with AI can become a huge breakthrough. This is not just about saving money, smart things, reducing human effort, or any trending hype. This is much more than that – easing human life. There are, however, some serious issues like the security concerns and ethical issues which will go on plaguing IoT. The big picture is not how fascinating IoT with AI seems, but how the common people perceive it – a boon, a burden, or a threat.

Title: Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode
Abstract: X-ray data can be collected with zero-, one-, and two-dimensional detectors, zero-dimensional (single counter) being the simplest and two-dimensional the most efficient in terms of measuring diffracted X-rays in all directions. To analyze the single-crystal diffraction data collected with these detectors, several computer programs have been developed. Two-dimensional detectors and related software are now predominantly used to measure and integrate diffraction from single crystals of biological macromolecules. Macromolecular crystallography is an iterative process. To monitor the progress, the HKL package provides two tools: (1) statistics, both weighted (χ2) and unweighted (R-merge), where the Bayesian reasoning and multicomponent error model helps obtain proper error estimates and (2) visualization of the process, which helps an operator to confirm that the process of data reduction, including the resulting statistics, is correct and allows the evaluation of the problems for which there are no good statistical criteria. Visualization also provides confidence that the point of diminishing returns in data collection and reduction has been reached. At that point, the effort should be directed to solving the structure. The methods presented in the chapter have been applied to solve a large variety of problems, from inorganic molecules with 5 Å unit cell to rotavirus of 700 Å diameters crystallized in 700 × 1000 × 1400 Å cell.

Title: Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV): high-performance genomics data visualization and exploration
Abstract: Data visualization is an essential component of genomic data analysis. However, the size and diversity of the data sets produced by today’s sequencing and array-based profiling methods present major challenges to visualization tools. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems. IGV is freely available for download from http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv, under a GNU LGPL open-source license.

Title: Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP
Abstract: Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.
