In the era of Industry 4.0, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly applied to enhance productivity and sustainability across various sectors, including agriculture [1]. Within agriculture, ML applications span crop management, livestock, water, and soil management, utilizing sensor data to evolve farm management into real-time AI-enabled decision support systems [2]. These data-driven approaches are foundational to Smart Farming, where efficient crop data management from acquisition to variable rate applications helps optimize resource use and minimize environmental impact [5]. In precision agriculture for grain crops, computer vision combined with AI algorithms has proven effective for disease detection, grain quality assessment, and phenotyping [4], with deep learning models employing transfer learning demonstrating high accuracy in automatically classifying crop leaf diseases [3]. Overall, these technologies are establishing the groundwork for sustainable agriculture by enabling reliable, automated systems that support informed decision-making and align with the goals of precision farming and forthcoming population demands [3], [4], [5].
